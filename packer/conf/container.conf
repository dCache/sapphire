# This is the configuration file for the pack-files, verify-container and stage-files python scripts.
#
# It contains general configuration and a list of per directory configuration
# about how the files in these directories should be bundled together into
# archives.


# Global configuration:
# script_id: An id that is appended to filenames of logs for example
# log_level: The level at which the scripts log, allowed values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# mongo_url: The URL where the MongoDB listens on, starting with mongodb://
# mongo_db: The name of the database in the MongoDB
# working_dir: A directory where the scripts are storing temporary data
# loop_delay: The time in seconds that pack-files wait between each packing run
# webdav_door: The URL to dCache WebDav-door
# macaroon: Path to a file that contains a macaroon that gives permission to the scripts to access archives and files in dCache
# frontend: The URL to dCache frontend
# driver_url: The URL to Sapphire driver running in dCache
# keep_archive_time: The time without any access, stage-files keeps a local copy of archives for staging
# quota: maximum number of concurrent container on local filesystem, -1 for no restriction
# verify: Set to true if certificates should be checked; Set to a path to CA Bundle files if the certificate needs additional CAs to be verified; Set to false to not check certificates -> not recommended!!

# Packer sections
# The following values are needed for packing:
# file_expression: A regex pattern for files to be packed
# s_group: A regex pattern for the store group that should be packed
# store_name: A regex pattern for the store name that should be packed
# archive_size: Size of an archive, supported units: K, M, G
# min_age: The minimal age the files must have to be packed, unit is minutes
# max_age: The maximal age the files may have before being packed into smaller archives, unit is minutes
# verify: Method to verify archive. Possible values are filelist, chksum and off while chksum is not implemented yet
# path_expression: Regex for the path that should be packed
# archive_path: Path where the archive is written to in dCache

# Example 1:
# Pack all files below the directory "/pnfs/sf-root/all" into archives of size
# 20G, potentially mixing files from different subdirectories as soon as they
# arrive (minAge = 0) and collect remaining files if their combined size is
# less than the target archive size (here 20G) after (maxAge =) 60 minutes.
# No additional checks are done to ensure archive integrity.
#
# Please note that the archivePath must not start with /


# [Example1]
# pathExpression=/pnfs/sf-root/all
# fileExpression=.*
# sGroup=.*
# storeName=.*
# archivePath=example1
# archiveSize=20G
# minAge=0
# maxAge=60
# verify=off


# Example 2:
# Pack all files below the directory "/pnfs/sf-root/split into archives of size
# 5G, separating them by directory, after they exist for at least 120 minutes.
# Pack remaining files after 600 minutes. To ensure archive integrity the
# archives content table is compared with file list.

# [Example2]
# pathExpression=/pnfs/sf-root/split/.*
# fileExpression=.*
# sGroup=.*
# storeName=.*
# archivePath=example2
# archiveSize=5G
# minAge=120
# maxAge=600
# verify=filelist


# Example 3:
# Pack all files matching the regular expression "^/pnfs/sf-root/home/[^/]*/archive$ into archives
# of size 1G, after they exist for at least 1440 minutes. Pack remaining files
# after 14400 minutes. To ensure archive integrity the archive is unpacked and
# all files will be compared by their checksums.

# [Example3]
# pathExpression=/pnfs/sf-root/home/[^/]*/archive
# fileExpression=.*
# sGroup=.*
# storeName=.*
# archivePath=example3
# archiveSize=1G
# minAge=1440
# maxAge=14400
# verify=chksum
